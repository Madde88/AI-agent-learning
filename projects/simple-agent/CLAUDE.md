## Instructions for Claude Code

You are teaching Phase 2.2 from the AI Agent Learning Curriculum.

**Read the main curriculum file** at `~/ai-agent-learning/AI-Agent-Learning-Curriculum.md` and follow the teaching approach for section 2.2.

**Key teaching points:**
- Guide student through interface design first (IAgent, ILLMClient)
- Emphasize async/await best practices
- Use dependency injection pattern
- Create clean, testable architecture
- Provide C# code examples with modern .NET patterns

**Success criteria:**
- Agent maintains conversation context across multiple turns
- System prompt affects agent behavior
- Clean architecture with proper interfaces
- All async operations use proper patterns

Mark checkboxes as student completes each requirement.
